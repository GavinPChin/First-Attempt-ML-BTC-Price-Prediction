I took on this project in the summer of 2022. 
It's my first project on something ML-related, I know there could be many improvements on it so it's still a work in progress.

I used an LSTM recurrent model to train data retrieved from Coinbase because this model is good at processing and predicting time-series data.

Weirdly testing data and model-predicted data are identical in patterns and very close to each other, possibly due to some fitting problem with my model.

Good learning experience, I'll come back to it as I learn. :)
